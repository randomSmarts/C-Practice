FIXME: This description is wrong This program repeatedly prompts the user to enter the name of a text file and
counts the number of words in that file. If the file opens successfully, the
program displays the total word count; otherwise, it displays an error message.
The user can continue entering filenames, and the program terminates when the
user enters "quit". All results are printed to the console.
