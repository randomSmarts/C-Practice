//Fixme this description is wrong
This program quizzes the user on arithmetic problems and provides performance
feedback. The user specifies how many problems to attempt per set. The program
then presents three sets of problems: addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
For each set, the user can specify the maximum number used in the problems. The
program displays one problem at a time, checks whether the answer is correct,
and keeps track of the score for each set. At the end, it prints a report
showing the number of correct answers, total problems, and percentage accuracy
for each set and overall.
